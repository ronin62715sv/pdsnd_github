### Udacity SQL Project
Investigate a Relational DVD Rental Database. 

### Description
The purpose of this project is to understand more about customer demand and behaviour patterns for movie rentals by querying a DVD rental database. Each of the 4 queries were made to analyze and bring up relevant data results to answer questions on movie rental demand to gain better understanding of the customer base. 
 - What family friendly movie category was rented out the most?
 - What family friendly movie category had the largest total amount of rental duration days?
 - What category had the most movies rented for the longest duration?
 - What day of the week are family friendly movies rented the most on average?

### Refactoring Note
The following improvements were done based on the feedback recieved from the first SQL project submission;
 - Queries 1, 2, and 4 were fixed to output data that doesnt require additonal processing before visualization.
 - Queries 1, 2, and 4 were fixed to output data that sorts from greatest to least for better visualization.
 - Query 3 outputs quartile data in column format that helps to create the recommended clustered bar chart visualization without additional processing.
